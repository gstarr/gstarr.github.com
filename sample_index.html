                Hi! I'm <a href="mailto:me@gstarr.me">Graham Starr</a>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm a junior at <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a>, pursuing a double major in <a href="http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090530201709/memoryalpha/en/images/b/bb/Starfleet_command_emblem.png">International Relations and Physics</a>, with a minor in Linguistics. My focus is on <b>innovation</b>, specifically in the cross-sectionality of interdisciplinary fields, and the ways in which we can apply <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11024-012-9191-9">science and technology to international affairs</a>. I have experience with design, web development, journalism, public speaking and speechwriting, and public relations, among other things, and hope to combine them in some capacity in the future. I am currently the General Manager of <a href="http://www.wmfo.org/">WMFO Medford</a>, Tufts Freeform Radio, the Public Relations Director and Webmaster for the <a href="http://www.alliescivmil.org/">Alliance Linking Leaders in Education and the Services (ALLIES)</a>, a national civil-military relations group, and the Managing Editor for <a href="http://www.ase.tufts.edu/zamboni/"><i>The Zamboni</i></a>, Tufts' Only Intentionally Funny Publication. In my spare time, you can see me performing stand-up comedy, learning a new language, doing something musical, or reading. You can find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/GrahamStarr">@GrahamStarr</a>, check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>, see what cool <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> I'm working on, or find out other ways to <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.
